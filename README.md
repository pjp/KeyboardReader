Translate keyboard input into two motor control outputs for skid steering - Python Code

This package is part of a project to use a Raspberry Pi to read inputs (from a wireless keyboard) and translate 
specific input keys to a pair of motor control values.

By controlling the speed and direction of a pair of DC motors, the technique know as Skid Steering can be used.

There are unit test to exercise the code and give an indication of usage of the package.
